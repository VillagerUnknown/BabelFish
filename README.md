Adds a fish that, when consumed from a bucket, provides translations and world hints to the player.

**Features:**

* Babel Fish Mob

**Babel Fish Mob**

The Babel Fish can talk to players and, when consumed from a bucket, can provide translations for other species to the player.

Babel Fish have a small chance to spawn in Rivers and a slightly higher chance to spawn in variations of the Warm Ocean.

**Babel Fish Translator Status Effect**

With the Babel Fish Translator status effect applied, players will see translations in chat whenever a nearby mob makes a noise.

The frequency of chat messages for translations can be controlled through the config.
